  <h1>Consent &amp; Privacy Agreement</h1>

  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Consent &amp; Privacy Agreement explains in clear language how this App collects and uses your data, and your rights regarding that data. Our app analyzes the emotions in text you provide by sending it to an artificial intelligence (based on generative pre-training transformer) service. Before you use the app, please read the following terms. By tapping "Accept" or using the app, you explicitly consent to the practices described here. If you do not agree, please do not use the service.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to be transparent and comply with global privacy laws like the European Union's GDPR and California's CCPA, among others. We want you to feel confident that your personal information is handled with care, and that you remain in control of your data.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="what-data-we-collect">
    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We only collect data that is necessary to provide you with emotional analysis insights. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Text You Provide:</strong> The words, sentences, or messages you input into the app for analysis. This text may include personal information you choose to share (for example, descriptions of your feelings or situations). We do not inherently require your name, contact details, or other identifiers in the text, but any personal details you include in your input will be treated as personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional Analysis Results:</strong> The artificial intelligence generated emotional insight or feedback based on your text. This result is derived from your input and is shown back to you. We consider these results as personal data about you (since it reflects information about your emotional state).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data (Limited):</strong> Basic technical information collected automatically when you use the app, such as anonymized device information, app version, and usage frequency. We collect this to improve app stability and user experience. This data does not include the content of your messages and is not used to identify you.</li>
      <li><strong>No Sensitive Sensor or Location Data:</strong> We do not access your phone's contacts, camera, microphone, or precise location data for this service. The app focuses solely on text analysis that you voluntarily provide.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect any data beyond what is listed above. In particular, we do not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13 (or applicable age of digital consent in your region). If you are under this age, please do not use the app without parental consent.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="how-we-use-your-data">
    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data only for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Emotional Analysis Service:</strong> Your input text is transmitted securely to our Artificial Intelligence analysis provider (a gpt-based API) to analyze the emotional tone and content. The Artificial Intelligence processes your text and returns an emotional insight or summary, which we then display to you in the app. This processing is fully automated. No human at our company reads your text during this analysis process.</li>
      <li><strong>Providing Results to You:</strong> The emotional analysis results are shown only to you (within the app interface). We might temporarily cache these results on your device or our servers to allow you to review your recent analyses, but this is primarily for your convenience.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Improvement (Aggregated Data):</strong> We may use aggregated, anonymized information about how users interact with the app (for example, the number of analyses performed per day, or general trends in usage) to help us improve the app's features and reliability. These statistics do not contain any personal text or identifiable information about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance and Protection:</strong> If necessary, we will use or disclose data to comply with legal obligations or valid governmental requests (for example, responding to a court order), or to enforce our Terms of Service and protect the rights and safety of our users, our company, or others. We will inform you if such disclosure is required by law, unless legally prohibited.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your personal text or analysis results for advertising or marketing purposes. We will never read your input text for any purpose other than what you've consented to (emotional analysis), and we will not profile you or make automated decisions affecting your legal rights or finances. The AI's interpretation of your emotions is only used to provide feedback to you and not to make decisions about you.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="where-how-your-data-is-processed">
    <h2>Where and How Your Data is Processed</h2>
    <p>To perform the emotional analysis, your text and the resulting insights are processed through a secure Artificial Intelligence platform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence Processing (Third-Party Service):</strong> We use a trusted third-party Artificial Intelligence service (specifically a gpt-based API) to analyze your text. This means your text is sent to the Artificial Intelligence provider's servers, where the Artificial Intelligence model processes it and generates an emotional analysis result. The data transfer is encrypted in transit to protect your privacy. The provider does not use your text for purposes other than providing the analysis and may retain it briefly (e.g., for 30 days) for abuse monitoring or debugging before automatic deletion.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Our app minimizes data storage. Text you submit is sent for analysis in real time and is not permanently stored on our servers by default. Analysis results may be temporarily cached to display recent results, but we do not build a permanent profile linked to your identity.</li>
      <li><strong>International Data Transfer:</strong> Depending on your location and the AI service's servers, your data might be processed in a different country. We take steps to ensure your data remains protected and use approved legal mechanisms for such transfers when required.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> We use industry-standard security measures including encryption in transit, firewalls, and access controls. Although no system is 100% secure, we actively monitor and update our security practices.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="how-long-we-keep-your-data">
    <h2>How Long We Keep Your Data</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described above, or as required by law:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your Text Inputs:</strong> Your inputs are stored for as long as you use the app. If you delete your account, your inputs will be deleted.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Logs:</strong> Basic usage data or error logs (without your text content) may be retained for troubleshooting and improvement purposes, typically for 30 days.</li>
      <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence Provider Logs:</strong> The AI service provider may keep system logs for up to 30 days for monitoring and debugging before deletion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If there is any data we must keep longer to comply with legal obligations (such as a court order or tax law), we will isolate that data and retain it only for the required period.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="sharing-your-data">
    <h2>Sharing Your Data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data to anyone. We only share your data in the following limited situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence Analysis Provider:</strong> Your text is shared with our third-party AI service provider solely to generate an emotional analysis result. They are contractually bound to maintain confidentiality and security.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Providers and Partners:</strong> Other trusted service providers assist in operating the app or processing aggregated usage data. They process your data under our instructions and are not permitted to use it for any other purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your data if required by law, legal process, or to protect the safety and rights of users or the public. We aim to share the minimum amount of information necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In events like mergers or acquisitions, your data may be transferred to a successor or new owner who will honor this agreement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>No Sale of Personal Data:</strong> In compliance with applicable laws such as the CCPA, we confirm that we do not exchange your data for money or valuable consideration.</p>
    <p><strong>No Third-Party Advertising:</strong> Your analysis and personal data are not shared with advertisers or social media platforms, ensuring a private experience.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="your-rights-and-choices">
    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have control over your personal data. Under various privacy laws, you are granted several rights, which we honor:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, including any text inputs and analysis results.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Correction (Rectification):</strong> Request correction of any incorrect or incomplete information.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> Ask us to delete your personal data, keeping in mind that removal of essential data may affect the service.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Change your mind at any time, stopping further data processing for emotional analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> Request your data in a common electronic format for transfer to another service.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Know (CCPA specific):</strong> For California residents, request details about the categories and sources of personal information we collect.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale (CCPA):</strong> Since we do not sell your personal data, you are automatically opted out of any sale.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> Exercise your privacy rights without fear of receiving a lesser service.</li>
      <li><strong>Rights for Other Regions:</strong> If additional rights are provided in your jurisdiction, we will honor those as well.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can exercise these rights by contacting us or through available app settings or web portals. We may verify your identity before processing requests and will respond within the legal timeframes.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="withdrawal-of-consent">
    <h2>Withdrawal of Consent</h2>
    <p>Your consent is the basis for processing your personal text data. If at any point you no longer wish us to process your inputs or share them with the AI service, you can withdraw consent by contacting us directly or through the app settings.</p>
    <p>After receiving your withdrawal request, we will stop sending your data for AI analysis immediately and delete any personal data that is not required for legal or operational reasons.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="ai-generated-insights">
    <h2>AI-Generated Insights Are Not Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>The emotional feedback and insights provided by our app are intended for personal awareness and informational purposes only. They are not medical advice, psychological counseling, or a diagnosis. The AI is not a licensed professional.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Professional-Patient Relationship:</strong> Using this app does not create a doctor-patient or therapist-client relationship. Consult a qualified professional for serious concerns.</li>
      <li><strong>Not a Substitute:</strong> Do not base major life decisions solely on AI analysis. Seek help from a mental health professional in emergencies or significant distress.</li>
      <li><strong>Accuracy and Limitations:</strong> The AI's analysis may be incorrect or incomplete and should be viewed only as informational.</li>
      <li><strong>No Liability for Decisions:</strong> We are not responsible for any actions or decisions you make based on the AI-generated insights.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="updates">
